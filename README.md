# GitHub Follower API

## Overview

GitHub Follower API utilizes the `followers` endpoint of the GitHub v3 REST API in order to return a collection of usernames that follow a given user, as well as the followers of their followers.

**Important:** The JSON data returned will only contain the usernames of the top 100 followers up to 4 layers deep.
